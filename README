Modified version of Tetris implemented using LÖVE.
Networking is an important part of the gameplay, as it is completely
multiplayer, VS mode, Co-Op and Controller mode.
VS and Co-Op mode are what you'd expect from it.
Controller mode is where you select the block the other player has to use.

Networking is done using LUBE, a library created by me.

See <http://love2d.org> for more information about the LÖVE game engine.
Libraries used are on the forums of that engine.
